Quantitative Features of EEG Recorded in the Delivery Room Immediately After Birth
==================================================================================

EEG features from term infants recorded minutes after birth. To accompany publication:

`D Finn, JM O'Toole, EM Dempsey, GB Boylan, EEG for the Assessment of Neurological
Function in Newborn Infants Immediately After Birth, Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,
2018`
[DOI:10.1136/archdischild-2018-315231](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2018-315231)


Features are generated using NEURAL (version 0.3.4; [code on
github](https://github.com/otoolej/qEEG_feature_set)); see reference [1] for more details.

# Files
- `qEEG_term_newborns_delivery_suite_ANON.csv`: feature set as comma-separated
  variable file. Will open in Excel (or equivalent).
- `LICENCE.md`: terms of use.

Brief description of each feature (see [1] for more details):
